* Chapter 1 - Creating project template and GitHub repository

Creating a well-structured project directory and HTML file is crucial for any web development project. 
It serves as the foundation upon which we will build our movie collection showcase.

By separating concerns and organizing our files into dedicated directories (styles and scripts), we keep our code modular and maintainable. 
The <section> element with the ID movie-list provides a designated area where we will dynamically add our movie cards using JavaScript.

* Chapter 2 - Creating the movies database to export

Creating separate data files is a common practice in web development. 
It allows us to keep our data organized and separate from the application logic. 
By storing the movie data in a JavaScript file, we can easily import and use it in different parts of our application.

In this chapter, we created an array of movie objects, each containing properties like title, poster, and description. 
These properties provide the necessary information to generate the movie cards in our showcase.

Exporting the movies array using the export keyword allows us to import it in other files using the import statement. 
This way, we can access the movie data and use it to generate the movie cards dynamically.
